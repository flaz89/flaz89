### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Flavio

**`Junior Dev || Digital Designer`** (Full-stack dev | Graphic | 3D modeling)

I've ditched my fashion designer gig to chase a freshly discovered passion that grabbed me right away: software development.

Iâ€™m all about creating and building. Eager to bring ambitious and exciting projects to life, and oh boy, Iâ€™m so here for the learning - all fuelled by a curiosity thatâ€™s always defined me. Iâ€™m the new kid on the tech block, embarking on a long and boundless journey. But hey, I'm totally up for the ride and all the rewarding moments itâ€™s gonna bring!
